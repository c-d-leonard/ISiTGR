# ISiTGR
Integrated Software in Testing General Relativity

Version 2.01

Developed by Jason Dossett, Mustapha Ishak, and Jacob Moldenhauer.

What is ISiTGR?

ISiTGR is an integrated set of modified modules for the software package CosmoMC for use in testing whether observational data is consistent with general relativity on cosmological scales. This latest version of the code has been updated to allow for the consideration of non-flat universes. It incorporates modifications to the codes: CAMB, CosmoMC, and the ISW-galaxy cross correlation likelihood code of Ho et al. Also included is our independently developed generalized weak lensing likelihood module with data sets for the CFHTLenS weak lensing tomography of Heymans et al and CFHTLens 2D weak lensing measurements from Kilbinger et al.

A detailed explanation of the modifications made to these codes allowing one to test general relativity are described in our papers: arXiv:1109.4583, arXiv:1205.2422, and arXiv:1501.03119.

How to get ISiTGR

The two versions of ISiTGR have been consolidated into a single package. The three methods of evolving the parameters used to test general relativity, as described in our paper arXiv:1109.4583, are all contained within the code below. Different evolution methods are chosen by using different .ini files and changing options within those files.

This version of ISiTGR is for the July 2015 version of CosmoMC. The original (flat only) verison of ISiTGR as well as builds for other versions of CosmoMC are available here .

Running ISiTGR. (See further below ReadMe-II)
To run ISiTGR you must first download and install CosmoMC (July 2015 version). You can find download instructions, system requirements, and setup instructions for CosmoMC in the CosmoMC ReadMe. Then, simply copy the contents of the unzipped ISiTGR folder to the CosmoMC folder, edit the Makefile for your compilers, compile using "make isitgr", and you are ready to go. To use the functional evolution of the modified gravity parameters, run the code with an ini file based on test_ISiTGR.ini. To use one of the binning methods run using an ini file based on test_ISiTGR_BIN.ini (Please Note: some changes to these ini files may be may be neccessary in order to run with the Planck 2013 likelihoods). Detailed explanations of the specific options available in ISiTGR are availalble in the ISiTGR ReadMe.

Introduction

ISiTGR is an integrated set of modified modules for the software package CosmoMC for use in testing whether observational data is consistent with general relativity on cosmological scales. This latest version of the code has been updated to allow for the consideration of non-flat universes. It incorporates modifications to the codes: CAMB, CosmoMC, and the ISW-galaxy cross correlation likelihood code of Ho et al. Also included is our independently developed generalized weak lensing likelihood module with data sets for the CFHTLenS weak lensing tomography of Heymans et al and CFHTLens 2D weak lensing measurements from Kilbinger et al.

To use ISiTGR you must first download and install CosmoMC (July 2015 version). You can find download instructions, system requirements, and setup instructions for CosmoMC in the CosmoMC ReadMe. Then, simply copy the contents of the unzipped ISiTGR folder to the CosmoMC folder, edit the Makefile for your compilers. Compile using the command make isitgr, and you are ready to go.

Basic usage of ISiTGR is the same as CosmoMC. See below for extra options in the .ini files.

Differences between ISiTGR and CosmoMC
Other than the changes to the code to incorporate the parameters used to test general relativy as described in our papers: arXiv:1109.4583 and arXiv:1205.2422, the following additional changes have been made

ini files
There are two input ini files provided with ISiTGR. test_ISiTGR.ini allows you to run the code with the MG parameters evolved using our the functional form evolution. test_ISiTGR_BIN.ini allows you to run the code with the MG parameters evolved using one of the binning methods. The following options are available in boths of these ini files.
To run the ISW-galaxy cross correlation likelihood code, uncomment the line DEFAULT(batch2/ISWHo.ini) in the test_*.ini file that you are using.

To use the CFHTLenS weak lensing tomography data set simply make sure the line DEFAULT(batch2/CFHTLens.ini) is uncommented in test.ini. This file enables use of the full CFHTLenS data sample as described in Heymans et al. If you would like to use one of the other galaxy samples instead you can change that line to:
"Early Type," Red sample - DEFAULT(batch2/CFHTLens_red.ini)
"Late Type," Blue sample - DEFAULT(batch2/CFHTLens_blu.ini)
"Optomized Early Type" sample - DEFAULT(batch2/CFHTLens_rfbb.ini)
These files each contain various settings to enable the different data sets as well as the default parameter ranges for the CFHTLenS intrinsic alignment (IA) nuissance parameter, ACFHTLenS, which allows this parameter to vary from -10 to 10. If you would like to fix this parameter to 0 and thus ignore the (IA) signal you can add the following line at the end of test.ini:
param[CFHTLensA] = 0

To use the CFHTLens 2D weak lensing data set from Kilbinger et al, simply add the line DEFAULT(batch2/CFHTLens_2D.ini) to your test_*.ini.
Additional parameters and options for testing general relativity: Functional Evolution
The file batch2/common_ISiTGR.ini contains lines the line: parameterization = ISiTGR which tells CosmoMC that we want to use the functional evolution of the MG parameters.

The following options have been included in batch1/params_ISiTGR_defaults.ini

The option: Use_R_Function = lets you decide which parameters for testing GR you want to evolve using the funcitonal form shown in our paper. Setting this option to T evolves the parameters Q and R, while setting this option to F evolves Q and Î£ (previously called D).
For varying the parameters used to test GR we add the following parameter lines, please refer to our paper for a detailed explanation of each of these parameters.
param[Q0] = 1 0 10 0.05 0.05

param[Qinf] 1

param[Sigma0] = 1 0 10 0.05 0.05

param[Sigmainf] = 1

param[kc] = 0.01

param[s] = 0 0 3 -1 1

The option: Scale_Dependent = lets you decide whether the evolution of the parmaters is scale dependent. Setting this option to T enforces scale dependence, and the parameters ending in inf above should be varied or changed to whatever value you want the parameters to take on small scales.

Additional parameters and options for testing general relativity: Binning Methods
The file batch2/common_ISiTGR_BIN.ini contains lines the line: parameterization = ISiTGR_BIN which tells CosmoMC that we want to use the binning methods to evolve the MG parameters.

The following options have been included in batch2/params_ISiTGR_BIN_defaults.ini

For varying the parameters used to test GR we add the following parameter lines, please refer to our paper for a detailed explanation of each of these parameters.
param[Q1] = 1 0 10 0.05 0.05

param[Q2] = 1 0 10 0.05 0.05

param[Q3] = 1 0 10 0.05 0.05

param[Q4] = 1 0 10 0.05 0.05

param[Sigma1] = 1 0 10 0.05 0.05

param[Sigma2] = 1 0 10 0.05 0.05

param[Sigma3] = 1 0 10 0.05 0.05

param[Sigma4] = 1 0 10 0.05 0.05

param[kc] = 0.01

The option: z_grid_spacing = defines the size of your bins in redshift bins.
The option: Do_Exponential_Binning = lets you choose how you want to transition between scale bins. Setting this option to T sets transitions between scale bins to behave as an exponential function with a decay constant kc (This is the hybrid method described in our paper). Setting this option to F sets transitions between scale bins to behave as a hyberbolic tangent functions (near step functions) with the bins divided at k = kc.

ISW-galaxy cross correlation likelihood code
To implement the ISW-galaxy cross correlations likelihood code of Ho et al, the following files have been added to source/: lrg_2dCl.f90 and iswdata.f90 . The files jl.f90 and lrg_pk.f90 have been removed in this latest version of the code.
The folder bdndz_code which contains c-codes called by the routine Iswlnlike in iswdata.f90 has been added to the root directory. These c-codes are compiled by running the make isitgr command from the top level cosmomc directory.
When Iswlnlike calls the c-program dndz.x it passes input files and output file names to the program. By default, these files are saved in the IO directory within the bdndz_code directory, however you can enable writing of these files to a different directory by setting the environmental variable TMPDIR.

Generalized Weak Lensing Likelihood module and Codes
ISiTGR includes a generalized weak lensing likelihood module, source/WeakLen_Common.f90. This module defines the derived type TCosmologyWLLikelihood and various associated procedures. From this derived type, one can define specific routines for various weak lensing likelihoods. The specific routines relating to the CFHTLens data sets are contained in CFHTLens.f90. All of these files are located in the source directory.
These files are loosely based upon the files contained in the original COSMOS weak lensing likelihood code of Lesgourges et al.
